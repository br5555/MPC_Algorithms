# MPC_Algorithms

Adjusting well known algorithams for using in MPC control

## Getting Started

  * Clone project
  * position inside cloned folder
  * make build file
  * position inside build file
  * type command : cmake ..
  * then: make .

### Prerequisites

* CMAKE
* some C++ compiler

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
